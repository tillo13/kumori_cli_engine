## Introduction
InstantID  [InstantID GitHub](https://github.com/InstantID/InstantID) has an excellent, tuning-free approach to identity-preserving generation, allowing for the swift creation of stylized portraits with a singular input image. The original InstantID implementation, leverages state-of-the-art AI to achieve remarkable fidelity in generated images, supporting a wide range of artistic renditions while preserving the unique identities captured in source images.

InstantID is accessible through user-friendly interfaces like Gradio, facilitating easy experimentation for users without deep technical expertise in command-line tools or programming. While this approach demystifies AI's complexities, it often caters to one-off generation tasks rather than batch processing or integrated workflows that many developers and researchers may require, I wanted to be able to "set it and forget it" to generated images.

Since its realized I have been testing a way to automate InstantID in conjunction with various working HuggingFace models to offer a more versatile and automation-friendly solution. This approach is designed for those seeking deeper customization, speed in batch image processing, and a more scriptable interaction with InstantID's capabilities, bypassing the GUI constraints for increased flexibility and efficiency.

## Why a CLI-based Approach?
The motivation behind developing a CLI-based interface for InstantID interaction stems mostly from the fact that I have an RTX3060, and waiting for an image to just try another bunch of settings was too time consuming, and would rather create several, and decide for myself what felt best, based on some of the ideal settings at differing strengths --it's worked out pretty good so far, so thought I'd share.

This project, therefore, extends the original brilliance of InstantID into a realm where developers and researchers can harness its capabilities in a more flexible, efficient, and programmable manner, opening new avenues for creative and analytical tasks without relying on graphical interfaces.

### Manual Installation Instructions

For those who prefer or need to install everything manually, detailed step-by-step instructions for the Kumori CLI engine, certain prerequisites must be in place:

1. **Python 3.8 or Newer**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.8 or newer.

2. **Git**: Git is essential for cloning the project repository to your local machine. If you do not have Git installed, please follow these instructions to install it:

#### Installing Git

- **Windows**:
  a. Download the latest Git for Windows installer from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
  b. Run the installer and follow the installation prompts. Accepting the default options is recommended for most users.

- **macOS**:
  a. Git might already be installed on your machine. You can check by running `git --version` in the Terminal.
  b. If you don't have Git installed, the easiest way to install it is via the standalone installer:
      - Download the latest macOS Git installer from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
      - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
  c. Alternatively, you can install Git using Homebrew (if installed):
      - Run `brew install git` in the Terminal.

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
  a. Open the Terminal.
  b. Update your package lists with `sudo apt update`.
  c. Install Git by running `sudo apt install git`.
  d. Verify the installation with `git --version`.

3. **Virtual Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to prevent conflicts with other Python projects or system-wide packages.

## Recommendation: Using a Python Virtual Environment

A Python virtual environment (venv) offers a self-contained directory within a project, encapsulating its own installation directories for software and packages. This isolation prevents conflicts between project dependencies and system-wide Python installations. It's highly recommended for projects like the Kumori CLI tool, where specific versions of libraries and dependencies are critical for functionality and stability. Below is a guide to setting up and managing a Python virtual environment for this project.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

a. **Installation**
   - Ensure Python 3.8 or newer is installed on your system. The Python installation includes `venv` for creating virtual environments.
   
b. **Creating a Virtual Environment**
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux).
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```
   - Create the virtual environment:
     - **Windows**:
       ```cmd
       python -m venv kumori_venv
       ```
     - **macOS/Linux**:
       ```bash
       python3 -m venv kumori_venv
       ```

   `kumori_venv` is the name of your virtual environment, and you can rename it to anything you like.

c. **Activating the Virtual Environment**
   Before installing packages and running your project, you need to activate the virtual environment. Once activated, any Python or pip commands will use the versions in the virtual environment, not the global Python installation.
   - **Windows**:
     ```cmd
     .\kumori_venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source kumori_venv/bin/activate
     ```

   You'll know the virtual environment is activated because the command prompt will show the name of your virtual environment, e.g., `(kumori_venv) user@hostname:~/path/to/project$`.

4. **Clone the Kumori CLI Project**: Now that you have a virutal env, Python, and Git installed, clone the project repository to your machine via [Kumori CLI Engine GitHub Page](https://github.com/tillo13/kumori_cli_engine.git) to have access to the functionality by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```
    cd path\to\location\you\want
    git clone https://github.com/tillo13/kumori_cli_engine.git
    cd kumori_cli_engine
    ```

5. **Install Required Libraries**: 
Once downloaded install the required libraries: 
    ```
    pip install -r kumori_cli_engine/requirements.txt -v
    ```

    This will ensure all necessary Python libraries, such as `diffusers`, `opencv-python`, `insightface`, `dlib`, and others, are installed in your environment.  It might take a few minutes, the -v tells it to show verbosely, but can take 5+ mins, be patient.

6. **Install PyTorch**: The requirements.txt file installs a standard pytorch version, but if you have an NVIDIA card, you want your own version from [PyTorch.org](https://pytorch.org --it will show your install command on the page itself. If you installed or have it installed, you might need to uninstall a previous version first...

```
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
```

...as the requirements.txt file might install a version not compatible with your card.  Specifically UNINSTALL is needed, before proceeding with your CUDA verison. 

While CUDA is not strictly necessary for running the tool, using a GPU can significantly accelerate the image generation process. Without a CUDA-enabled GPU, the generation process can be markedly slowerâ€”taking roughly 5-10 minutes per image based on standard inference steps and configurations in `configs.py`. For my setup with an NVIDIA RTX 3060, images are processed overnight, yielding a batch of outputs by the morning. To install PyTorch with CUDA support for an NVIDIA GPU, use the following command:

Commands will differ slightly to incorporate CUDA support:

For GPU-enabled systems (assuming CUDA is available), visit [PyTorch's Get Started page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to select a command fitting your setup. An example for CUDA 11.8:

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

For systems without GPU support, a standard PyTorch installation suffices:

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

For my RTX3060, this is the command I get from pytorch.org on the homepage: 

    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

and it will show something like:

    (kumori) PS D:\test> pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    Looking in indexes: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    Collecting torch...


If you do not have a CUDA-enabled GPU, you can visit [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the appropriate installation command for CPU-only support. Remember, the CUDA version (`cu118` in the command above) should match your system's CUDA installation if using GPU acceleration.


7. **Additional files needed via Google Drive**: For facial detection and landmarks analysis and AntelopeV2, ensure you have the following models in your `facial_landmarks_model` and `model` directories in the root of the project (download from the PLACEHOLDER_ links in the repo as too big for Github) --download them both and unzip them into the kumomri_cli_engine directory: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jdfyvxHMvAN7OJMW3zGn0IZZ107OxmqN/view?usp=sharing

    - `deploy.prototxt.txt`
    - `pose_deploy_linevec.prototxt`
    - `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel`
    - `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`

    These models are crucial for the `gender_detect.py` and `estimate_similar_faces.py` scripts to function correctly, allowing for accurate gender detection and pose estimation.

  At the end you should have 2 folders called `kumori_cli_engine/models` and `kumori_cli_engine/facial_landmakr_model` after downloading the files.

8. ***Run it!***
Make sure you're in the kumori_cli_engine directory and run: 

    python ./kumori_cli.py
    
If all goes as planned, you should start seeing values populating in the generated_images folder!
